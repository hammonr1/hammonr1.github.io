### **Portfolio**
**AI/ML**

[Agentic AI for Nuclear Physics](/AAIFNP/)
* Developing natural language interfaces for multi-agent systems that automatically configure and execute complex stockpile design simulations on HPC clusters.

[Privacy Savvy EV Charging Optimization](/PSEVCO/)
* Implementing federated learning model to predict electric vehicle charging times while preserving user privacy across distributed charging networks.

[Quantum-Safe Federated Learning](/QSFL/)
* Designed privacy-preserving mechanisms to protect federated learning systems from hardware-based side channel attacks in quantum computing environments.

[Intelligence Analytics for Piracy Detection](/IAFPD/)
* Built a scalable data pipeline using fuzzy matching and geospatial algorithms to verify vessel movement patterns and destination accuracy.

[AI-Powered Materials Discovery](/AIPMD/)
* Built a self-contained ecosystem where machine learning models predict and test the CO2 absorption performance of new solvent molecules, accelerating the discovery of next-generation carbon capture materials.
