I deployed federated learning models for electric vehicle charging time prediction that preserve user privacy while optimizing charging network efficiency. The system enables accurate predictions across distributed charging stations without centralizing sensitive user data, addressing both technical performance and privacy concerns in smart grid applications. This work demonstrates how privacy-preserving AI can enhance sustainable transportation infrastructure while protecting individual user information.
